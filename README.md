I've recently finished the RHCSA cert and course materials, and I wanted to collect all useful info and scripts in the same repo to be useful for anyone who wants to certify RHCSA or even to my future-self.
NB: This material is based on Pluralsight certification prep plus some simple explanation between here and there.
